# Currency converter
Currency converter sample app

Description: 

The user has a multi-currency account with starting balance of 1000 Euros (EUR). He can convert any currency to any if the rate is provided by the API but the balance can't fall below zero. Create an input where the user will enter amount, picker for currency being sold and a picker for currency being bought.

For example, user inputs 100.00, picks Euros to sell and Dollars to buy. User then clicks Submit button, a message is shown You have converted 100.00 EUR to 110.30 USD and now the balance is 900.00 Euros and 110.30 US Dollars.

Also, there may be a commission fee for the currency exchange operation. The first five currency exchanges are free of charge but afterwards they're charged 0.7% of the currency being traded. The commission fee should be displayed in the message that appears after the conversion.
